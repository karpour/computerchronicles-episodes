We take a look at how your PC may very likely have its own compliance problems to deal with in the year 2000.\n\n[Episode #1703, First broadcast: 3/16/1999]\n\nPCfix 2000\nMike Johnston from the About Time Group, helps us understand the hardware side of the Year 2000 problem. From the CMOS on your mother board, to the BIOS in the operation system, he shows us what these chips look like and where they are in the computer. Mike also introduces us to PCFix 2000, a program that will run a check to see if your CMOS and BIOS (both must be problem free) are 100% Y2K ready.\n\nSymantec\nDana Prussoff demonstrates Symantec's Norton 2000 product. This software is particularly helpful in determining what Y2K problems you might have with your software applications and data files.\n\nMicrosoft\nDon Jones, with Y2K Readiness at Microsoft, gives us the perspective of the world's leading PC operating system and software vendor. Don shows us an example of a problem with Windows 98 and where to find the fix at the MS Web site. He also talks about fixes for MS application software (also available at the MS Web site).\n\nWindows Magazine\nMike Elgan, Editor of Windows Magazine, shows us what resources are available on the Web for anyone concerned about the Y2K problem. He points out what Windows Magazine has been saying and what its readers have been saying in their Y2K discussion area. He also shows us what information the US Government is offering (also for the general consumer) and the information available at a general interest Y2K Web site. Finally he takes us to a \"survivalist\" Web site, one that assumes the coming of the millennium is going to cause worldwide havoc.\n\nY2K in the Wider World\nCome January 1",

AuctionWatch.com's services provide businesses with the tools necessary to efficiently distribute merchandise and acquire customers, while providing a convenient service for customers to locate and purchase these products. AuctionWatch.com's powerful suite of services is centered on three main areas: Seller Services, Buyer Services, and Fulfillment Solutions.\n\neSnipe.com\neSnipe serves one primary purpose for power buyers on eBay: it places bids for them during the last few seconds of the auction, a practice known as \"sniping\" in the online auction world. eSnipe reduces bidding wars by masking interest in auction items until the last possible moment. Because auctions on eBay take three to 10 days to close, emotional overbidding can start soon after the auction opens and last until the auction closes, instead of mere minutes as is the case in traditional offline or \"outcry\" auctions.\n\nStrong Numbers\nThe Strong Numbers Blue Book provides instant fair market pricing information based on actual online transactions so consumers can determine what a product is worth before they buy or sell.

        tvdb_description: "This week's episode of Computer Chronicles features some technological advances in medicine and health from robotics to medical information management.\n\n[Episode #1918, First broadcast: 1/15/2002]\n\nWe start off showing you an application for your PDA that helps you monitor your health by digitally keeping track of information such as medicine dosages or sugar levels. HealthEngage is a product from FireLogic that works as a data management resource for your body's health information. Sharon Pizer demonstrates how an asthma patient who normally uses paper and a pencil can digitally record, and share with a doctor, information such as peak flow meter ratings that measure lung functionality.\n\nThen, Dr. Mark Leavitt explains how Medscape is taking paper medical charts and turning them into a digital format. Medical charts with patient summaries come up in an instant and doctors who use a tablet computer for the application can enter information through speech recognition. And, a doctor can make this digital information available online for the patient through a highly secured site called aboutmyhealth.com.\n\nNext up is astounding new robotics technology that allows a doctor to perform a surgical procedure on a patient across the world. We show you the first ever complete surgical procedure that has been performed on a human being using tele-surgery. A doctor in New York uses the \"Zeus Robotic Surgical System\" developed by Computer Motion based in Santa Barbara, California to remove a gallbladder from a patient in France. It's made possible by a transatlantic fiber optic network by France Telecom that connects the remote surgeon to the robot in the operating room.\n\nThen, Dr. Harold Portnoy talks about a new website called YourSurgery.Com that can improve the communication between patients and doctors about likely outcomes and risks of surgery. The site educates the patient about the background of the medical problem, including the anatomy and pathology, and then",

The merger of the information technology in an IBM supercomputer and the biology know-how of Johns Hopkins creates not just visual, but also functional models of organs. Nunes demonstrates how medical researchers use a complex artificial heart model to explore the data and electrical impulses in the heart. This allows researchers to determine the beneficial and adverse effects of various drugs on organs resulting in a speedier process of discovering and approving new drugs.\n\nNext up, a group called BABEC that helps students in the San Francisco Bay Area understand DNA shows us how DNA data applications are being explored in the lab and in classroom. Octavio Rodriguez and a high school student Austen Chin perform a typical lab procedure used to extract and analyze DNA samples. They also explain how DNA is used to make insulin for humans, modify genes, and identify criminals.\n\nThen, we find out how a genetic modification experiment on a Rhyseus monkey will help us understand the causes of diseases and allow us to test innovative therapies that can eradicate them. Researchers Dr. Gerald Schatten and Dr. Anthony Chan from the Oregon Health Sciences University explain how they genetically engineered a monkey to carry a gene normally found in jellyfish. If the experiment is successful, the monkey will produce a protein that will make him glow in the dark.\n\nNanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at the atomic level, is explored with Dr. Stan Williams from Hewlett-Packard Labs Quantum Science Research Center.

Bob Cottam, the Chief IT Integrator and Xavier Roig, the General Manger of Major events both for SchlumbergerSema explain how they built a massively redundant network on the side of a snow covered mountain, guaranteed its security and provided sub-second information throughout the network. Michael Fischer, the Regional IS Manager at the Utah Olympic Park talks about how the technology in Salt Lake City had to be 100% reliable and provided data at extreme speeds. The CIS, or Commentator Information System, made it possible for announcers to have athletes' data in synch with events as they were happening. And, Jason Durrant, the Director of System Testing for SchlumbergerSema, describes the difficulties of integrating software for different sports where each has their own rules and requirements.\n\nThen, Nick Harris, the Assistant Venue IS Manager for the Utah Olympic Park, talks about the constant upgrades, debugs and testing that was required to ensure there were absolutely no slippages in an event where second chances do not exist. We also see how techies were able to close the system at the Information Technology Center so that it was bulletproof and safe from hackers. Also, the network backbone at these games was Unix; Dan Smith, VP of Sales for Sun Microsystems, along with Dave Prestwich, Unix Team Manager for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, describe the massive installation of Sun servers and data storage units.\n\nBob Donohoo, Senior Network Engineer for IKANO, the data-networking supplier, tells the story of how they",

Then, we discover how the Salt Lake City organizers integrated custom software images for the unique needs of different sports, then distributed thousands of computers with 50 different applications to eleven venues housing 15 different sports using a scanner/bar code system.\n\nWe also demonstrate the three main systems, Info 2002, Commentator Information System and Games Management System that SchlumbergerSema provided. The Commentator Information System, CIS, allowed for announcers to have information on event happenings in milliseconds; we show you what commentators were seeing during freestyle skiing and hockey events. Bob Cottam, the chief IT Integrator with SchlumbergerSema, talks about how all these systems were kept running with 100% reliability using a standby data center. Bob Donohoo, Senior Network Engineer from Ikano, describes how self-healing technologies from Quest also contributed to the network's reliability. Meanwhile, Xavier Roig, Major Events General Manger at SchlumbergerSema, outlines the importance of testing and simulation for the people running the network.\n\nTechies weren't the only ones testing the limits of technology.

Mike Elgan from Interex first explains how spammers get your email address when you post it anywhere on the Internet. Then, he demonstrates how to create junk email folders in Outlook and also how to use the 'Rules Wizard' to create macros that get rid of junk mail. Elgan says you should not respond to junk mail and you should use two email addresses, reserving one for public use.\n\nAnd, there are many effective anti-spam applications that you can download from the Internet as well. PCWorld.com's Andrew Brandt recommends \"SpamKiller\" that runs filters then dumps junk mail in a \"killed file\" and \"Spam Buster\" that runs filters with splashier animations. Brandt also talks about \"MailWasher\" , a free advertising supported service that gives you the most ability to customize their filters using regular expressions. Brandt says that experts predict by 2005, most people will be receiving 40 spams per day. \n\nThen we take a look at the consequences of spam, identity theft and child abuse. An identity thief victim talks about how her name, social security number and credit card was stolen on the Internet while a hacker describes the vulnerabilities that allow them to break into systems. Tom Poledge from Symantec explains how Norton Internet Security Software can protect you by preventing designated items from being sent to insecure websites. \n\nMailshell is an intelligent email system that allows you to customize your inbox to avoid spam.

Canberra Secondary School is one example of how Singapore is investing technology in schools to create high quality education. Vice Principal Leon Meng Yin shows us how students use smart cards to record their attendance and order their lunches. Chowiz.com is a web-based system that provides a cashless lunchroom and allows parents to monitor their children's consumption. We also see the school's e-newspaper and radio station that students produce using iMacs. Ng See Sing, General Manager of National Computer Systems explains how SMS applications can be utilized in education situations to communicate test results to students and to inform parents of their children's progress. \n\nThen we visit an e-learning company, Ednovation, to see how this Singaporean company is going beyond CD-ROMs to provide educational programming on the Web. Richard Yen, Managing Director of Ednovation, says since 90% of the population here has access to broadband, so the essential infrastructure is in place to pipe learning materials into the home. \n\nAnd, the public library, located in a shopping mall in Singapore, uses technology to make learning more accessible. They use RFID cards, or Radio Frequency ID, in books to automate checking in and out. You can also use your cell phone to check out books and get a SMS when your book is available.\n\nSingapore is also a country challenged for space so technology is also being used here to relieve congestion.

Dr. Edison Liu says now that the human genome has been laid out, scientists here are finding what each of the proteins are responsible for and what biological functions they perform. They are seeking system biology, taking genomic knowledge and linking it with cell biology and medicine. And, as they look for that one protein appropriate for pharmaceuticals, a fundamental tool is high-end computational capabilities that can handle analysis and database requirements for many terabytes of data. Dr. Liu says Singapore's enlightened view of biomedical research encourages researchers in the country while still maintaining ethics for the people. \n\nThe Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology takes a different approach to genetic research. B. Venkatesh says scientists here are studying the fugu fish because it has the smallest genome size of all the vertebrates while still having the same number of genes as humans; and sequencing the fugu fish will enable them to identify all the genes in the sequence of the human genome. Researchers at this institute are identifying genes that may be useful for developing cures for human diseases by discovering how the genes function, how they are regulated and what turns them on and off.\n\nAnother approach in Singapore to curing diseases is studying millions of natural products found in soil to see if microorganisms can be useful in pharmaceuticals.

        tvdb_description: "This is the conclusion of a three-part Computer Chronicles special series exploring high tech developments in Singapore.\n\n[Episode #1941, First broadcast 6/25/2002]\n\nInvesting in people is a large part of Singapore's plan to develop their high-tech and biotech economy. The Institute for Communications Research is one of the educational research centers where they specialize in optical technology, wireless technology and second generation Internet. Here they developed the Delphi Pad with Ericsson, which is a portable computer, electronic textbook and Internet terminal. It uses new 3G technology and SIP, Session Initiation Protocol, which is a new Internet-based telephony standard. The Delphi Pad uses 802.11 and Bluetooth wireless technologies. The Institute is also working with RFID technology that lets you embed electronic tags in objects without requiring a source of power. This could be used in the future to create smart packaging so boxes in a store could register themselves in inventory databases. Lye Kin Mun, Deputy Director at ICR, talks about how they converted RF energy in to power from large distances and says they extended the range of existing RFID technology from inches to 3 meters. \n\nThey are also working on perfecting 3G technologies on next generation cell phones. A \"smart antennae\" could increase the speed and bandwidth enabling improved data communication for handhelds. And next generation Internet at this center uses QOS, Quality of Service, technology to improve data streamed over the Internet by identifying and prioritizing packets being sent over the network.\n\nSingapore is also developing creative technology skills at Nanyang Polytechnic where they specialize in Digital Media Design. Students use programs such as Macromedia Director, Shockwave, 3D Studio Max, and Adobe Premier to create educational role-playing games, robot characters and animations. Students are also doing cutting edge work using a programming language called WML to des",

You can use Expedia to sort options by shorter flights or departure times and you can also find a hotel based on the specific neighborhood for your travels. Robinson also explains how you can put together a customized travel package in real-time as you choose the accommodations and travel arrangements. He says that the large number of people using Expedia allows them to negotiate easier with airlines to get better deals for their users.\n\nIndependent online travel expert, Ed Hasbrouk, gives us tips from his recently published book \"The Practical Nomad Guide to the Online Travel Marketplace\". Hasbrouk explains the difference between fares and prices and helps us understand how consolidators negotiate with airlines to set their own prices. One of his biggest tips is to research many sites to get the best airfares because no single place can promise the best prices. He discusses sites Orbitz.com, jetBlue.com, AirTreks.com, SideStep.com, Qixo.com, FareChase.com, and Farebeater.com on OneTravel.com.\n\nThe site that claims to have more total bookings than anyone else online is Travelocity.com and CEO Terrell Jones discusses the benefits of using this online travel-booking giant. Jones explains how e-tickets work, how you can obtain updated flight information better online than over the phone and how to compare various vacation packages side by side on the site.\n\nTo find out the secrets to getting your bid on travel auction websites, we go to Mike Dougan, the Sensible Traveler columnist at the San Francisco Chronicle. Dougan explains how Priceline is not really a place to bid for",

        tvdb_description: "In this episode of Computer Chronicles, we show you how to protect yourself against spam, your email's most notorious enemy. \n\n[Episode #1943, Re-broadcast: 7/9/2002]\n\nTo begin with, there are many anti-spam tools already on your computer that you may not know about. Mike Elgan from Interex first explains how spammers get your email address when you post it anywhere on the Internet. Then, he demonstrates how to create junk email folders in Outlook and also how to use the 'Rules Wizard' to create macros that get rid of junk mail. Elgan says you should not respond to junk mail and you should use two email addresses, reserving one for public use.\n\nAnd, there are many effective anti-spam applications that you can download from the Internet as well. PCWorld.com's Andrew Brandt recommends \"SpamKiller\" that runs filters then dumps junk mail in a \"killed file\" and \"Spam Buster\" that runs filters with splashier animations. Brandt also talks about \"MailWasher\" , a free advertising supported service that gives you the most ability to customize their filters using regular expressions. Brandt says that experts predict by 2005, most people will be receiving 40 spams per day. \n\nThen we take a look at the consequences of spam, identity theft and child abuse. An identity thief victim talks about how her name, social security number and credit card was stolen on the Internet while a hacker describes the vulnerabilities that allow them to break into systems. Tom Poledge from Symantec explains how Norton Internet Security Software can protect you by preventing designated items from being sent to insecure websites. \n\nMailshell is an intelligent email system that allows you to customize your inbox to avoid spam. Eytan Urbas describes how the product works to block bad email and manage good email when you register and create alternative addresses for different purposes like shopping or auction bidding. With Mailshell, you can create specific filters for individual addresses and",

Bob Cottam, the Chief IT Integrator and Xavier Roig, the General Manger of Major events both for SchlumbergerSema explain how they built a massively redundant network on the side of a snow covered mountain, guaranteed its security and provided sub-second information throughout the network. Michael Fischer, the Regional IS Manager at the Utah Olympic Park talks about how the technology in Salt Lake City had to be 100% reliable and provided data at extreme speeds. The CIS, or Commentator Information System, made it possible for announcers to have athletes' data in synch with events as they were happening. And, Jason Durrant, the Director of System Testing for SchlumbergerSema, describes the difficulties of integrating software for different sports where each has their own rules and requirements.\n\nThen, Nick Harris, the Assistant Venue IS Manager for the Utah Olympic Park, talks about the constant upgrades, debugs and testing that was required to ensure there were absolutely no slippages in an event where second chances do not exist. We also see how techies were able to close the system at the Information Technology Center so that it was bulletproof and safe from hackers. Also, the network backbone at these games was Unix; Dan Smith, VP of Sales for Sun Microsystems, along with Dave Prestwich, Unix Team Manager for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, describe the massive installation of Sun servers and data storage units.\n\nBob Donohoo, Senior Network Engineer for IKANO, the data-networking supplier, tells the story of how they manipulated fiber ca",

Then, we discover how the Salt Lake City organizers integrated custom software images for the unique needs of different sports, then distributed thousands of computers with 50 different applications to eleven venues housing 15 different sports using a scanner/bar code system.\n\nWe also demonstrate the three main systems, Info 2002, Commentator Information System and Games Management System that SchlumbergerSema provided. The Commentator Information System, CIS, allowed for announcers to have information on event happenings in milliseconds; we show you what commentators were seeing during freestyle skiing and hockey events. Bob Cottam, the chief IT Integrator with SchlumbergerSema, talks about how all these systems were kept running with 100% reliability using a standby data center. Bob Donohoo, Senior Network Engineer from Ikano, describes how self-healing technologies from Quest also contributed to the network's reliability. Meanwhile, Xavier Roig, Major Events General Manger at SchlumbergerSema, outlines the importance of testing and simulation for the people running the network.\n\nTechies weren't the only ones testing the limits of technology. Speed skaters wore the new Nike Swift Skin body suit that reduced friction by 55% and has been called the most technically advanced piece of sports equipment available. The apparel innovation director at Nike, Rick MacDonald, says the suit was developed from computer analysis of wind tunnel studies to create just th",

Plus we'll show you the latest version of Internet Explorer and the Macintosh OS.\n\n[Episode #1946, Re-broadcast: 7/30/2002]\n\nWe begin with Denny Arar from PC Magazine who explains what's new about Windows XP Home. She'll talk about the instant messenger applications, remote assistance and web cam tools that are now all bundled in this operating system. Arar also shows how you can customize personal settings for each user and she discusses the pros and cons of upgrading to XP.\n\nThen, we get an overview of the Windows XP Professional edition with Rob Enderle from Giga Information Group. He says it's almost identical to the Home edition but the professional version allows for easier access to all the printers and storage areas in a heavy-duty network. Enderle goes over some of the features of the operating system such as the ability to pull information from an old machine to a new one and the ability to discover nearby wireless networks. And, if the system is crashing, XP allows you to restore the system to an earlier point where it was working. Rob says the product is a jump in security and reliability but they could have made more advances in the areas of wireless networks.\n\nIn addition, we show you the hoopla Microsoft created when launching this new product. In addition to worldwide events, promotion strategies in the U.S. included autograph sessions in computer stores, music from Madonna in commercials and a Sting concert in New York City.\n\nMicrosoft also has an upgraded browser with Internet Explorer V.6, an element already built into Windows XP. Mike Elgan from Interex compares IE V.6 to Netscape and guides us through some of the browser's new characteristics such as the picture re-sizer and the media bar that allows you to listen to music or watch videos in a side bar while brows",
