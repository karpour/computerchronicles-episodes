Macromedia Flash
Flash, a popular authoring software developed by Macromedia, is used to create vector graphics-based animation programs with full-screen navigation interfaces, graphic illustrations, and simple interactivity in an anti-aliasing, resizable file format that is small enough to stream across a normal modem connection. The software, currently in version 5.0, is ubiquitous on the Web, both because of its speed (vector-based sites, which can adapt to different display sizes and resolutions, play as they download) and for the smooth way it renders graphics. Flash files, unlike animated but raster graphics Graphics Interchange Format and JPEG, are compact, efficient, and designed for optimized delivery.

[Episode #1939, First broadcast 6/11/2002]

Singapore is a country without natural resources, so investing in its people becomes crucial in achieving a model high-tech society of the future. Canberra Secondary School is one example of how Singapore is investing technology in schools to create high quality education. Vice Principal Leon Meng Yin shows us how students use smart cards to record their attendance and order their lunches. Chowiz.com is a web-based system that provides a cashless lunchroom and allows parents to monitor their children's consumption. We also see the school's e-newspaper and radio station that students produce using iMacs. Ng See Sing, General Manager of National Computer Systems explains how SMS applications can be utilized in education situations to communicate test results to students and to inform parents of their children's progress. 

Then we visit an e-learning company, Ednovation, to see how this Singaporean company is going beyond CD-ROMs to provide educational programming on the Web. Richard Yen, Managing Director of Ednovation, says since 90% of the population here has access to broadband, so the essential infrastructure is in place to pipe learning materials into the home. 

And, the public library, located in a shopping mall in Singapore, uses technology to make learning more accessible. They use RFID cards, or Radio Frequency ID, in books to automate checking in and out. You can also use your cell phone to check out books and get a SMS when your book is available.

Singapore is also a country challenged for space so technology is also being used here to relieve congestion. The ERP, or Electronic Road Pricing System, monitors and regulates traffic into the main city with a smart",,2002-06-11,,,,,

At the Genomic Institute of Singapore, researchers are following up on the breakthrough of the sequencing of the human genome. Dr. Edison Liu says now that the human genome has been laid out, scientists here are finding what each of the proteins are responsible for and what biological functions they perform. They are seeking system biology, taking genomic knowledge and linking it with cell biology and medicine. And, as they look for that one protein appropriate for pharmaceuticals, a fundamental tool is high-end computational capabilities that can handle analysis and database requirements for many terabytes of data. Dr. Liu says Singapore's enlightened view of biomedical research encourages researchers in the country while still maintaining ethics for the people. 

The Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology takes a different approach to genetic research. B. Venkatesh says scientists here are studying the fugu fish because it has the smallest genome size of all the vertebrates while still having the same number of genes as humans; and sequencing the fugu fish will enable them to identify all the genes in the sequence of the human genome. Researchers at this institute are identifying genes that may be useful for developing cures for human diseases by discovering how the genes function, how they are regulated and what turns them on and off.

Another approach in Singapore to curing diseases is studying millions of natural products found in soil to see if microorganisms can be useful in pharmaceuticals. Merlion Pharmaceuticals uses high throughput screening methods for testing thousands of samples for their exact biological activity.

Investing in people is a large part of Singapore's plan to develop their high-tech and biotech economy. The Institute for Communications Research is one of the educational research centers where they specialize in optical technology, wireless technology and second generation Internet. Here they developed the Delphi Pad with Ericsson, which is a portable computer, electronic textbook and Internet terminal. It uses new 3G technology and SIP, Session Initiation Protocol, which is a new Internet-based telephony standard. The Delphi Pad uses 802.11 and Bluetooth wireless technologies. The Institute is also working with RFID technology that lets you embed electronic tags in objects without requiring a source of power. This could be used in the future to create smart packaging so boxes in a store could register themselves in inventory databases. Lye Kin Mun, Deputy Director at ICR, talks about how they converted RF energy in to power from large distances and says they extended the range of existing RFID technology from inches to 3 meters. 

They are also working on perfecting 3G technologies on next generation cell phones. A ""smart antennae"" could increase the speed and bandwidth enabling improved data communication for handhelds. And next generation Internet at this center uses QOS, Quality of Service, technology to improve data streamed over the Internet by identifying and prioritizing packets being sent over the network.

Singapore is also developing creative technology skills at Nanyang Polytechnic where they specialize in Digital Media Design. Students use programs such as Macromedia Director, Shockwave, 3D Studio Max, and Adobe Premier to create educational role-playing games, robot characters and animations.

A leader in the online travel marketplace, Expedia.com contains large amounts of travel information and Mitch Robinson shows us how to sort through it using various criteria. You can use Expedia to sort options by shorter flights or departure times and you can also find a hotel based on the specific neighborhood for your travels. Robinson also explains how you can put together a customized travel package in real-time as you choose the accommodations and travel arrangements. He says that the large number of people using Expedia allows them to negotiate easier with airlines to get better deals for their users.

Independent online travel expert, Ed Hasbrouk, gives us tips from his recently published book ""The Practical Nomad Guide to the Online Travel Marketplace"". Hasbrouk explains the difference between fares and prices and helps us understand how consolidators negotiate with airlines to set their own prices. One of his biggest tips is to research many sites to get the best airfares because no single place can promise the best prices. He discusses sites Orbitz.com, jetBlue.com, AirTreks.com, SideStep.com, Qixo.com, FareChase.com, and Farebeater.com on OneTravel.com.

The site that claims to have more total bookings than anyone else online is Travelocity.com and CEO Terrell Jones discusses the benefits of using this online travel-booking giant.

To begin with, there are many anti-spam tools already on your computer that you may not know about. Mike Elgan from Interex first explains how spammers get your email address when you post it anywhere on the Internet. Then, he demonstrates how to create junk email folders in Outlook and also how to use the 'Rules Wizard' to create macros that get rid of junk mail. Elgan says you should not respond to junk mail and you should use two email addresses, reserving one for public use.

And, there are many effective anti-spam applications that you can download from the Internet as well. PCWorld.com's Andrew Brandt recommends ""SpamKiller"" that runs filters then dumps junk mail in a ""killed file"" and ""Spam Buster"" that runs filters with splashier animations. Brandt also talks about ""MailWasher"" , a free advertising supported service that gives you the most ability to customize their filters using regular expressions. Brandt says that experts predict by 2005, most people will be receiving 40 spams per day. 

Then we take a look at the consequences of spam, identity theft and child abuse. An identity thief victim talks about how her name, social security number and credit card was stolen on the Internet while a hacker describes the vulnerabilities that allow them to break into systems. Tom Poledge from Symantec explains how Norton Internet Security Software can protect you by preventing designated items from being sent to insecure websites.

In this first of a two-part pecial series, we show you how SchlumbergerSema, the overall IT Integrator, put together one of the most secure networks ever built, managed databases and integrated software at the 2002 Olympics. Bob Cottam, the Chief IT Integrator and Xavier Roig, the General Manger of Major events both for SchlumbergerSema explain how they built a massively redundant network on the side of a snow covered mountain, guaranteed its security and provided sub-second information throughout the network. Michael Fischer, the Regional IS Manager at the Utah Olympic Park talks about how the technology in Salt Lake City had to be 100% reliable and provided data at extreme speeds. The CIS, or Commentator Information System, made it possible for announcers to have athletes' data in synch with events as they were happening. And, Jason Durrant, the Director of System Testing for SchlumbergerSema, describes the difficulties of integrating software for different sports where each has their own rules and requirements.

Then, Nick Harris, the Assistant Venue IS Manager for the Utah Olympic Park, talks about the constant upgrades, debugs and testing that was required to ensure there were absolutely no slippages in an event where second chances do not exist. We also see how techies were able to close the system at the Information Technology Center so that it was bulletproof and safe from hackers. Also, the network backbone at these games was Unix; Dan Smith, VP of Sales for Sun Microsystems, along with Dave Prestwich, Unix Team Manager for the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, describe the massive installation of Sun servers and data storage units.

We begin with the desktop operating system that helped run the Olympic Games and Scott Hunsworth, the PC Technician at Gateway, who describes why they used Windows NT and also shows off the flat screen monitor computer from Gateway that was used at the games. Then, we discover how the Salt Lake City organizers integrated custom software images for the unique needs of different sports, then distributed thousands of computers with 50 different applications to eleven venues housing 15 different sports using a scanner/bar code system.

We also demonstrate the three main systems, Info 2002, Commentator Information System and Games Management System that SchlumbergerSema provided. The Commentator Information System, CIS, allowed for announcers to have information on event happenings in milliseconds; we show you what commentators were seeing during freestyle skiing and hockey events. Bob Cottam, the chief IT Integrator with SchlumbergerSema, talks about how all these systems were kept running with 100% reliability using a standby data center. Bob Donohoo, Senior Network Engineer from Ikano, describes how self-healing technologies from Quest also contributed to the network's reliability. Meanwhile, Xavier Roig, Major Events General Manger at SchlumbergerSema, outlines the importance of testing and simulation for the people running the network.

She'll talk about the instant messenger applications, remote assistance and web cam tools that are now all bundled in this operating system. Arar also shows how you can customize personal settings for each user and she discusses the pros and cons of upgrading to XP.

Then, we get an overview of the Windows XP Professional edition with Rob Enderle from Giga Information Group. He says it's almost identical to the Home edition but the professional version allows for easier access to all the printers and storage areas in a heavy-duty network. Enderle goes over some of the features of the operating system such as the ability to pull information from an old machine to a new one and the ability to discover nearby wireless networks. And, if the system is crashing, XP allows you to restore the system to an earlier point where it was working. Rob says the product is a jump in security and reliability but they could have made more advances in the areas of wireless networks.

In addition, we show you the hoopla Microsoft created when launching this new product. In addition to worldwide events, promotion strategies in the U.S. included autograph sessions in computer stores, music from Madonna in commercials and a Sting concert in New York City.
